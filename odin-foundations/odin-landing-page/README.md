# odin-landing-page

### Description
This is my solution to the [Landing Page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page) problem of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

### Skills Required
- Intermediate HTML knowledge to correctly organize the structure of website in appropriate semantic tags
- Intermediate knowledge of CSS to take complete advantage of layout tools like flexbox

### Reflection
This project helped me in improving my flexbox skills. The portfolio website which I created recently made use of flexbox heavily & having studied flexbox
further here. I realize how powerful the `flex` property would have been, had I known this before. I am still not fluent at it, but that will take time
