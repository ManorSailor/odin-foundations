# odin-rock-paper-scissors

### Description
This is my solution to the [Revisiting Rock Paper Scissors](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-revisiting-rock-paper-scissors) problem of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

### Skills Required
- Intermediate knowledge of JavaScript & CSS
- Things like Loops, functions, logical & arithmetical operators, conditionals, DOM manipulation & event listeners.
- Things like animations, general resets, SVG manipulation etc.

### Reflection
This project helped me in improving my JS skills. I learned how I can make good use of data structures to shorten my conditionals.
I also learned a lot about DOM manipulation & took on a challenge to generate the playArea container completely through JS.
I was successful in doing that & I am glad!
It also helped me in thinking more deeply about the problem at hand. Games like rock, paper & scissors are so trivial in real life, because of human intuition.
The same thing is so complex if you want to teach it to a computer.

My main goal was to somehow improve my pseudocoding skills as well problem solving skills. I am not good at it. 
If I have already solved a problem before, I can easily break it down & write pseudocode for it. However, breaking down a brand new problem is challenging. I can't do that
The way I work is, i solve the problem in code first then write its pseudocode lol

If you are a beginner looking at the code & you don't understand anything. Don't worry, you will understand it in future.
I was able to come up with this solution because I have solved RPS in C before. Though, string in C are annoying that's why I used numbers to represent all the game elements
This is how I came up with this array strategy to solve this problem. Because user was already providing me 0, 1 or 2 as their choice, I declared a single array of losers & used their
main choice to get the losing element. I couldn't do this here because we had to work with "Rock, Paper & scissors" i.e, strings instead of ints

### Todo/Future Goals
- [ ] Re-implementing the whole project solely in JS
- [ ] Adding localStorage support to store scores
- [ ] Adding a match board to show all your previous matches
- [ ] Implementing a system to change game difficulty
