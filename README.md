# odin-pixel-sketch

### Description
This is my solution to the [Etch-a-Sketch](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch) problem of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

### Skills Required
- Intermediate knowledge of JavaScript, Data Structures & CSS
- Things like Sets, DOM manipulation, event listeners, loops & conditionals
- Things like `linear-gradient`, `wildcard selectors`, `pseudo classes & elements`, `css custom properties` & `css resets` etc

### Reflection
This was an interesting project to implement which sent me down several rabbit holes like:
- Difference b/w input & change event listeners & how they differ
- How to make git commit patches & manual hunk editing

One of the most challenging thing was organizing the project in a way which is easily extendable & I have tried my best to achieve it. Although, I haven't been able to perfectly. This is also one of the most frustrating part of this entire project, I have refactored my codebase multiple times just to ensure that it will be easily extendable in the future.
I had trouble in coupling tools with the canvas. I wanted the tool to work on the canvas when it was selected which sounds obvious but I had trouble coupling these two things together & this is also one of the reasons why I had to refactor my codebase multiple times.

I will be revisiting this project in the future & making improvements to it. I want to create an easily extendable codebase which allows easy integration of new tools & features. 

### Todo/Future Goals
- [ ] Adding an option to change background color of the canvas
- [ ] Adding an option to resize the grid manually & allowing rectangular canvas
- [ ] Adding localStorage support to store user settings
- [ ] Adding the ability to save their art
- [ ] Re-implementing the whole project solely in JS
- [ ] Adding tools which exist in other pixel art apps
