# odin-dashboard

### Description
This is my solution to the [Sign-up Form](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard) problem of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

### Skills Required
- Intermediate knowledge of JavaScript, OOP & CSS

### Reflection
This was a neat project, it helped me explore grid to its fullest. Although, I also explored a little bit of OOP programming with JS by creating a class of card & generating cards at runtime. 

- I learned a bit about OOPs, getters although it is still rusty
- Grid can be quite useful although the biggest limitation I found with is to have different sized responsive grid items which can break onto new lines when there isn't enough screen estate all while maintaining the desired size ratio.
- I wasted a lot of time by opting to change the webpage design midway, NEVER do that again.
- Also, for the love of god, do not separate CSS styles like I did in this project. If you have to, separate them on a per-component basis instead of just layout & styles. It got annoying to jump around between two files & the browser dev tools styles section got cluttered as well.

### Todo/Future Goals
- [ ] Design overhaul, I have a design in mind which I initially tried redoing midwa & failed miserably. Now, I am going to attempt it later
